After doing docker-compose up, and your table is gone? This is how you ingest the taxi trip data again:

Go to the code where you would copy and paste it in your terminal to run the ingestion script:
-------
URL="etc.etcâ€¦/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz"
docker run -it \
  --network=pg-network \
  taxi_ingest:v001 \
    --user=root \
    --password=root \
    --host=pg-database \
    --port=5432 \
    --db=ny_taxi \
    --table_name=yellow_taxi_trips \
    --url=${URL}
-------

Change:
1) 
--network=pg-network
Into
--network=2_docker_sql_default
( My guess why this works is b/c when you set up the compose, we didn't specify network name, so we are using the default name)
2)
--host=pg-database
Into
--host=pgdatabase
(In compose, the name we set for the service is also the host name )
